    <strong>T3</strong> is a repository for public wheat data generated by the Wheat Coordinated Agricultural Project 
    (<a href="http://www.triticeaecap.org/">Wheat CAP</a>). It also contains data from the US Uniform Regional Scab Nurseries, 
    supported by the US Wheat and Barley Scab Initiative (<a href="https://scabusa.org/">USWBSI</a>).  Funding is provided by the National 
    Institute for Food and Agriculture (<a href="https://nifa.usda.gov/">NIFA</a>) and the United States Department of Agriculture 
    (<a href="https://www.usda.gov/">USDA</a>). The current project is funded through NIFA's International Wheat Yield Partnership 
    (<a href="http://iwyp.org/">IWYP</a>) and part of the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative 
    (<a href="https://nifa.usda.gov/program/agriculture-and-food-research-initiative-afri">AFRI</a>). The database was developed
    at <a href="https://triticeaetoolbox.org/wheat?old=old">triticeaetoolbox.org/wheat</a>. That website was archived in Jan 2020 and all the data
    was moved to this current site.
