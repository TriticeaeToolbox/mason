<h2>Submit Phenotype Data</h2>

<p>To submit phenotype data to <% our $T3_INSTANCE_NAME %> follow these three general steps:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Create Upload Templates</h3>

<p>
    Data submitted to <% $T3_INSTANCE_NAME %> should be in the format of the upload 
    template for the data type you are submitting.  
    <a href='/help/phenotype_upload_workflow'>
        View the detailed upload instructions 
    </a> 
    for specific information on each data type.
</p>


<h3>Step 2: Add Data to Sandbox</h3>

<p>
    Once you have your upload templates, you can test-load them on this Sandbox site  
    to check for any errors.
</p>


<h3>Step 3: Submit Trial Data</h3>

<p>
    If your trial data has been successfully added to the Sandbox you can submit your trials 
    directly to the production site by clicking the <strong>Submit Trial</strong> button on 
    the trial detail page.
</p>
<p>
    If your data has not been added to the Sandbox or if you would prefer to submit your files 
    directly to the production site, you can submit your individual upload templates or data files to us 
    using the <a href='<% our $T3_PRODUCTION_URL %>/submit/pheno'>Phenotype Submission Form</a>.
